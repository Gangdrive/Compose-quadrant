In this exercise, you need to apply most of the concepts that you learned so far and then go a step further to explore a new Modifier and properties. This might look like an extra challenge, but don't worry! You can check the References section for this problem, where you can find the links to these Modifier classes and properties, and use them for implementation.

You need to build an app that displays the information about the Composable functions that you learned.

The screen is divided into four quadrants. Each quadrant provides the name of a Composable function and describes it in one sentence.

Final screenshot
After you finish the implementation, your design should match this screenshot:
